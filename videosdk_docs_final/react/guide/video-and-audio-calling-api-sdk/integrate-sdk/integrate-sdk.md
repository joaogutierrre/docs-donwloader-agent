**Source URL:** https://docs.videosdk.live/react/guide/video-and-audio-calling-api-sdk/integrate-sdk

Our React JS SDK provides a wrapper over JavaScript SDK converting it into usable React hooks API. It simplifies the code for React JS and makes integrating the Video and Audio calls in your app very simple.

### Installing React SDK​

You can install our React SDK by using Yarn or NPM package managers.

Before installing the React SDK, make sure you have the Node environment already setup on your machine.

```
npm install "@videosdk.live/react-sdk"
```

`npm install "@videosdk.live/react-sdk"`
```
yarn add "@videosdk.live/react-sdk"
```

`yarn add "@videosdk.live/react-sdk"`
If you are using a Windows machine, make sure to include the double-quotes while installation.

### Typescript Support​

From version 0.1.52 and higher, typescript is supported by our React JS SDK. It is not necessary to install additional types because they are already part of the NPM package.
