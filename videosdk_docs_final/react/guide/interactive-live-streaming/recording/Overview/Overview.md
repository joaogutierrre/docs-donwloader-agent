Recording meetings is an essential feature that ensures all important discussions, decisions, and interactions are documented for future reference. VideoSDK offers three types of recordings: Meeting Recording, Participant Recording, and Participant Track Recording. Each type serves a specific purpose to cater to different recording needs during a meeting.

### Meeting Recording​

Meeting Recording captures the entire meeting, including all participants, audio, video, and shared content. This comprehensive recording is ideal for reviewing the entire meeting, ensuring that nothing is missed. It provides a holistic view of the meeting, capturing every interaction and piece of information shared during the session.

### Participant Recording​

Participant Recording focuses on individual participants, capturing both their audio and video into a single file. This type of recording is particularly useful for tracking the contributions of specific participants or for scenarios where detailed analysis of an individual’s participation is needed. When a participant mutes their audio or turns off their video, the recording continues but with silenced audio or a black screen, respectively. This ensures a continuous recording without interruptions, reflecting the participant's involvement throughout the meeting.

### Participant Track Recording​

Participant Track Recording allows you to record specific tracks of a participant, either audio or video, based on user input. This targeted approach is perfect for capturing particular aspects of a participant’s contribution, such as only their audio or only their video. Multiple files are generated whenever there is a change in the track's status (e.g., starting after being muted ), ensuring focused documentation of each continuous segment. This method is especially useful in scenarios where detailed analysis of specific media (audio or video) is required.
